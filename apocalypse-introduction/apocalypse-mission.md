# Apocalypse Mission

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Apocalypse Mission By Revoluzion</mark>

Revoluzion and its various projects are designed for long-term sustainability, with ongoing updates and new developments planned for the future. One such project is the Apocalypse Play-to-Earn Non-Fungible Token (NFT) game, which utilizes the RVZ, APOC, and LZN tokens as in-game currency.&#x20;

The game is currently undergoing major development and revision to include the ability for players to earn multiple tokens from participating project owners in exchange for promotional advertising within the game. These ads will only be displayed when players engage in gameplay to earn the selected tokens.

In addition to the main game, Revoluzion also offers a battle arena and player versus player (PvP) feature, in which users can stake various tokens from Revoluzion ecosystem projects for the chance to win rewards. There is also a chance for players to receive mineral NFT airdrops if they lose their matches.&#x20;

The game also includes a "second drop" feature, which offers the chance for players to win a large pot of rewards regardless of whether they win or lose their battles. This feature adds an element of luck and additional opportunities for players to earn rewards within the game.

As part of Revoluzion's ongoing efforts to drive innovation within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, the company plans to develop additional decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts for use by external parties. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.&#x20;

These contracts facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. By developing dApps and smart contracts for third-party consumption, Revoluzion aims to provide a wide range of solutions and services to meet the needs of diverse clients and industries. The company is committed to ongoing evolution and development, with plans for the creation of additional platforms in the future.
