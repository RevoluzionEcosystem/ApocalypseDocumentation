# Apocalypse Expansion

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Apocalypse Expansion</mark>

The Revoluzion team is working on expanding their apocalypse gaming system to a global scale. With this expansion, project owners will be able to integrate the game into their decentralized application (dApp) and use it as a utility for player versus player (PvP) gameplay. Players can compete against each other to win staking rewards, making the apocalypse non-fungible token (NFT) a valuable asset with global usage potential. Any dApp that has integrated the apocalypse game will be able to utilize this NFT. This integration of the apocalypse game into dApps will allow for even more widespread adoption and usage of the game.

Integrating the apocalypse game into dApps has a number of potential benefits. For one, it allows for the game to be played within the context of a particular dApp, potentially making it more relevant and appealing to users of that dApp. For example, if a cryptocurrency exchange were to integrate the apocalypse game, users of the exchange could play the game and earn rewards while they trade. This could provide an additional incentive for users to engage with the exchange.

Another potential benefit of integrating the apocalypse game into dApps is the ability to use the game as a way to drive adoption and usage of the dApp itself. For example, a decentralized prediction market platform might integrate the apocalypse game as a way to attract more users and get them interested in using the platform. By offering the game as a utility within the platform, the prediction market dApp could potentially increase its user base and overall engagement.

Overall, the integration of the apocalypse game into dApps has the potential to bring the game to a wider audience and increase its usage and adoption. By offering the game as a utility within dApps, project owners can provide an additional layer of engagement and value for their users.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">How Do We Expand?</mark>

Revoluzion is excited to announce that we will be offering our clients the opportunity to integrate Apocalypse, our all-in-one service featuring smart contracts and dApps, directly into their own dApps. This integration will allow users of the dApp to participate in player versus monster (PVM) gameplay and earn rewards in the form of tokens from the project.

In addition to the integration, we will also be providing free usage of the Apocalypse dApp to our clients. This means that as long as they utilize and submit their tokens into the smart contract for their users to stake, we will deploy the dApp at no cost.

We believe that by offering these services, we can make it easier for clients to incorporate the Apocalypse game and provide added value to their users. We are confident that this integration will be a win-win for both Revoluzion and our clients, and we look forward to seeing the exciting ways in which our clients will utilize the Apocalypse game in their own dApps.
