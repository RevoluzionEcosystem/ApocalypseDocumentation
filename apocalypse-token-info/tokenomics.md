# Tokenomics

Apocalypse tokenomics are fairly simple and straight forward. There will be no burning of tokens at launch, burning will be done gradually over time.

All tokens are locked and vested until the year 2025. Having our liquidity pool locked for 2 years, with no unlocked tokens, ensures an extremely safe and secure project.

## Tax is crucial to sustain the reward pool

Many NFT games fail due to the inability to sustain the reward pool for players over time.

Reward pool is what stores all of the players rewards. To sustain the balance of the reward pool over time, there is a tax for almost every in-game purchase, level up, repairs, upgrades, crafting and more.

#### 2% to marketing wallet (to run constant ads and marketing)

#### 1% to liquidity pool (to increase the floor price)  &#x20;

#### 1% to smart contract for buyback and burn supply (to increase token value and bnb in LP)

#### 5% to reward pool (to sustain players rewards)

\
There will be transfer tax from wallet to wallet, both buy / sell including transfer tax are fixed at 9% (smart contract is hardcoded to never exceed tax above 10%)
