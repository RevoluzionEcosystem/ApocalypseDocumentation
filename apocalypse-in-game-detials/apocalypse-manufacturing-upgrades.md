### Crafting the future!

To ensure the marketplace is not flooded with an excessive amount of heroes NFTs, we implemented a burning mechanism in the heroes crafting section. When a player craft their heroes for higher class heroes, both NFT will be depleted upon success or failure.

By implementing a burning mechanism such as this, we sustain the game for a longer period of time and reduce the number of heroes NFTs in circulation. By reducing the supply of available NFTs, we increase demand for those NFTs and that increases the value. This heroes NFT burning concept is similar to burning tokens in order to reduce the supply, which in turn increases the value of each token / NFT.ll endurance before being able to post them for sale on the NFT marketplace.\
