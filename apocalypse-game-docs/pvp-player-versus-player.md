Players are able to create as many PVP room as possible, per character per room. Players character would not require any minimum health point, level or experience point to be eligible for PVP room creation or joining PVP room.

To create a **PVP** room, players would need to open up their character inventory, select the character they want to utilize for **PVP** and select create **PVP** room. Player would then require to enter the desired stake amount of **LZN** they wish to stake for the **PVP** battle and click create.

Once **PVP** room is created, players would only require to wait till someone joins their **PVP** room and battle. Player would not required to be logged into the dApp or stay connected to the dApp, everything is automated by the smart contract and blockchain itself.

After battle ends, player who won will automatically receive their share of stake **LZN** directly into their wallet, however, player who lost will also get a chance to receive mineral as airdrop as well. There will be a 10% tax from the total amount stake received directly stored in the smart contract, all of the stored **LZN** are used for **Second Drop** function while the rebased **LZN** will be automatically sent to the **Black Hole** dEAd address.

One lucky player will receive a **Second Drop** reward from the **PVP** smart contract after the cooldown period ends, players might get lucky at any given time frame and not fixed. Second drop is a feature in the original **Helbreath** game where at given time, players might get lucky to receive an additional drop from mobs and players.

**Second Drop** only occurs once after every 24 hours cooldown (variable depending on **PVP** volume), it will not trigger within the first 24 hours but only after and will not have a exact timestamp when it deploys. Player might get a second drop from minutes to days after the cooldown period, it is totally random. Amount of **LZN** a player will receive depends on the amount of taxation and rebases in the smart contract, the more **LZN** staked within that time frame, the more **LZN** tokens a player will receive for their **Second Drop**.

Players are also able to join PVP rooms created by another player, there are no limit as to how many PVP a player / character. Characters would not require to equip any weapon / wand and shield to be able to participate in PVP. Characters that joins PVP will not recover their health point or lose their health point, however, if player wish to recover his health point, he would then require to re-equip his character in the character tab.&#x20;

Players would require to approve LZN allowances in the main dashboard before being able to stake their LZN for PVP, this command authorize the smart contract to receive the stake LZN from players. If players are having issue not being able to create or join a PVP room, do proceed to our guide / FAQ section or contact any of the mods / team members for help.
