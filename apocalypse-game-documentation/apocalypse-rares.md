### Weapon Of Mass Destruction

The weapons found in Apocalypse have been designed and hand sketched by our own talented sketch designer, Ubai. Because the game was modeled after the MMORPG game Helbreath, many of the mob characters will resemble those found in the original Helbreath game.

Rare heroes and items are extremely rare and unique, they are not burnable and are extremely hard to get through minting. All rares are only obtainable through minting process. Rares are also not able to be upgraded nor level up as the stats are the highest possible stats possible in the game for all items.

Weapon, wands and shields NFTs must be unequip in the players inventory (on-chain) and they must also be at full endurance before being able to place them for sale in the NFT marketplace.
