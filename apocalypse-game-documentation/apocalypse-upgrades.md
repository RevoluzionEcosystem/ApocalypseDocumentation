### The Power Of Upgrades

Players are able to upgrade their weapons and wands to increase the attack points which in turn increases the winning success rate.

Upgrading the weapons and wands will also increase the endurance of the weapon and wand. Players would be able to have more amount of fight before having it to repair again. Weapons and wands are upgradable up to level 10, however there would be a burning mechanism implemented in upgrade section of the smart contract.

**Players that upgrade their weapons, wands and shields can lose/burn their NFT.** We strongly suggest to read the entire page or ask any of our game tech support / moderators for additional questions.\

### It Is The Perfect Upgrade!

To ensure the marketplace is not flooded with an excessive amount of items NFTs, we implemented a burning mechanism in the weapon upgrade section. The higher the level of upgrade used on an item, the higher the attack or defence point increase. However, the higher the level of upgrade used on an item, the higher the risk of burning the item NFT in the process. Of course, once burned, that specific NFT is gone forever.

By implementing a burning mechanism such as this, we sustain the game for a longer period of time and reduce the number of NFTs in circulation. By reducing the supply of available NFTs, we increase demand for those NFTs and that increases the value. This NFT burning concept is similar to burning tokens in order to reduce the supply, which in turn increases the value of each token / NFT.

### The Upgrade Flowchart Rates

We created a flow chart for players to understand how upgrades work and what are the success rate and depletion rate according to level.\

### The Upgrade Flowchart&#x20;

Weapon and Shield upgrade stats are all identical, except shield stats will increase base defence where as weapon and wands increases base attack points.
