### It's Time To Shield Apocalypse!

The shields found in Apocalypse have been designed and hand sketched by our own talented sketch designer, Ubai. Because the game was modeled after the MMORPG game Helbreath, many of the mob characters will resemble those found in the original Helbreath game.

We are fans of the original game, and this pays homage to the roots of our game!

Minting shields NFTs will require Apocalypse (APOC) Tokens. The number of tokens required will be equivalent to $50 USD, regardless of the price of the (APOC) token. Players can mint any number of shields they desire depending on available space in their inventory slots.

Shield NFTs must be stored in the players inventory (on-chain) and they must also be at full endurance before being able to post them for sale on the NFT marketplace.![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (124).png>)\

### Decrease HP Taken After A Win!

That's right! Shields are compulsory to be equip before a player hero can begin battle, players will not be able to start battle without a shield.

We are fans of the original game, and this pays homage to the roots of our game!

Shields are meant to increase the defence of a hero, the higher the defence rate is, the less health point is deducted from every fight won. However, battles that are lost, players will still take full health point deduction according to the mobster level.

Shield NFTs must be stored in the players inventory (on-chain) and they must also be at full endurance before being able to post them for sale on the NFT marketplace.
