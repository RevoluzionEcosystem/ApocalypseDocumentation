# Apocalypse Inventory

Apocalypse inventory is designed for players to store their NFTs such as characters, weapons, wands and shields. We understand players would always want to store their NFTs and all NFTs are stored on-chain.\

### Warehouse Storage For All!

The purpose of having an inventory slot is for players to always have a spare weapon, wands, shields and even heroes to be kept for future use. Inventory slots can be stored as long as the player wish, and storage are unlimited for all NFTs.

### Multi-Function Space!

To ensure the marketplace is not flooded with an excessive amount of weapon NFTs, we implemented a burning mechanism in the weapon upgrade section. The higher the level of upgrade used on a weapon, the higher the winning success rate. However, the higher the level of upgrade used on a weapon, the higher the risk of burning the weapon NFT in the process. Of course, once burned, that specific weapon NFT is gone forever.\
\
By implementing a burning mechanism such as this, we sustain the game for a longer period of time and reduce the number of NFTs in circulation. By reducing the supply of available NFTs, we increase demand for those NFTs and that increases the value. This weapon NFT burning concept is similar to burning tokens in order to reduce the supply, which in turn increases the value of each token / NFT.
