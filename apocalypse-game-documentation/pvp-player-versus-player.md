# PVP (Player Versus Player)

## <mark style="color:yellow;">What is PVP and how does it work in Apocalypse?</mark>

PVP stands for "player versus player" and refers to a game mode in which players can battle against each other for the amount of LZN tokens staked. In Apocalypse, PVP allows players to compete against each other in battles, with the winner receiving their share of the staked LZN. The process for creating and joining PVP rooms is straightforward, and the winner of each battle is determined through a randomizer smart contract. PVP is a popular feature in the game and offers players an exciting way to compete and earn rewards.

In Apocalypse, players have the ability to create and join as many Player vs Player (PVP) rooms as they wish, with one character per room. The process for creating a room is simple: players just need to open their character inventory, select the character they want to use for PVP, and select the "create PVP room" option. They will then need to enter the desired stake amount in LZN tokens and click "create." Once the room is created, players can wait for someone to join and start the battle. It's important to note that players do not need to be logged into the dApp or remain connected to the dApp during the battle, as everything is automated by the smart contract and blockchain.

After the PVP battle ends, the winning player will automatically receive their share of the staked LZN in their wallet. The losing player will also have the opportunity to receive minerals as an airdrop. A 10% tax will be taken from the total amount of staked LZN and stored in the smart contract. This stored LZN will be used for the Second Drop function, while the rebased LZN will be automatically sent to the Black Hole dEAd address.

The Second Drop is a feature in the original Helbreath game that gave players a random chance to receive an additional drop from mobs and players. In Apocalypse, the Second Drop occurs once every 24 hours (though this time may vary based on PVP volume) after the cooldown period. There is no exact timestamp for when the Second Drop will occur, and it can happen anywhere from minutes to days after the cooldown period. The amount of LZN a player will receive depends on the amount of taxation and rebasing in the smart contract – the more LZN that is staked during that time, the more LZN a player will receive in their Second Drop.

To determine the winner in PVP battles, Apocalypse uses a randomizer smart contract. There are five of these randomizers in the game, one for each feature. Character stats do not affect the outcome of the battle – winning and losing is completely random. This helps to ensure a fair system for all players to enjoy and compete against each other.

In terms of character eligibility for PVP, there are no minimum health point, level, or experience point requirements. Characters also do not need to equip any weapons, wands, or shields to participate. However, if a player wants to restore their character's health after a PVP battle, they will need to re-equip their character in the character tab. To stake their LZN for PVP, players will need to approve LZN allowances in the main dashboard. If players are having trouble creating or joining PVP rooms, they can check the guide/FAQ section or contact a mod or team member for assistance.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Is it possible to use multiple characters from the same wallet address to battle against each other?</mark></summary>

No, the smart contract does not allow characters from the same wallet address to battle against each other, even if they are different characters.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Can I delete my current PVP room and delist it?</mark></summary>

Yes you can, however, there will be 1% tax for withdrawing your PVP room.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;"><strong>Will I still have a chance receive mineral airdrops if I won?</strong></mark></summary>

No, only players who lost the battle will have a chance to receive mineral airdrops. This is to ensure players have a chance on receiving something even when they lost.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;"><strong>Can I stake other tokens or coin instead of LZN?</strong></mark></summary>

No, we will only utilize LZN for now till further notice.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;"><strong>Can I stake any amount i wish to?</strong></mark></summary>

Yes, however, the minimum stake is currently set at 1 BUSD worth of LZN and above. The minimum stake may be adjusted in the future based on certain variables.

</details>

<details>

<summary><mark style="color:yellow;">Does my character level or stats increases my chances of winning?</mark></summary>

The main reason is to ensure a more fair system. Additionally, including more factors in the selection process would require more functions in the smart contract, which would increase the gas fee. To keep the gas fee as low as possible, the selection process is kept fully random. This also helps to ensure that the system is 100% unmanipulated.
