### Wands Of The World

The wands found in Apocalypse have been designed and hand sketched by our own talented sketch designer, Ubai. Because the game was modeled after the MMORPG game Helbreath, many of the mob characters will resemble those found in the original Helbreath game.

We are fans of the original game, and this pays homage to the roots of our game!

Minting wand NFTs will require Apocalypse (APOC) Tokens. The number of tokens required will be equivalent to $30 BUSD, regardless of the price of the (APOC) token. Players can mint any number of wands they desire depending on available space in their inventory slots.

Wand NFTs must be stored in the players inventory (on-chain) and they must also be at full endurance before being able to post them for sale on the NFT marketplace.\

### Yes, I Wand It!

To ensure the marketplace is not flooded with an excessive amount of wand NFTs, we implemented a burning mechanism in the wand upgrade section. The higher the level of upgrade used on a wand, the higher the winning success rate. However, the higher the level of upgrade used on a wand, the higher the risk of burning the wand NFT in the process. Of course, once burned, that specific wand NFT is gone forever.

By implementing a burning mechanism such as this, we sustain the game for a longer period of time and reduce the number of NFTs in circulation. By reducing the supply of available NFTs, we increase demand for those NFTs and that increases the value. This wand NFT burning concept is similar to burning tokens in order to reduce the supply, which in turn increases the value of each token / NFT.
