# Apocalypse Heroes

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Apocalypse Heroes</mark>

In the game Apocalypse, players have access to two primary classes of characters, the Warrior and the Mage.

Warriors are physically-oriented characters, who specialize in melee combat. They are required to equip a weapon, such as a sword or an axe, and a shield before they are authorized to engage in battle.&#x20;

Mages, on the other hand, are spell-casting characters who specialize in ranged combat. They are required to equip a wand, which serves as their primary tool for casting spells, and a shield before they are authorized to engage in battle.&#x20;

It's important to note that the future update for the game will include more classes of heroes to be added for more variety of gameplay for the players.
